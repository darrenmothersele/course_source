Course Source Drupal Integration
--------------------------------


## Course Source API

This module provides a PHP wrapper around the Course Source API functions, 
a Drupal administration section to configure the API connection details, and
synchronisation of user accounts via the API.

## Course Source Admin

This module provides some extra administration pages that allow admins of the 
Drupal site to view all available courses and enrol users on courses. 

## Course Source MyCourses

This exposes a list of courses for the current logged in user as a page
(available at /course-souce), a block, and a field formatter for text fields.
